# The aim of this capstone project is to compare extreme weather differences in the region of
# Kosovo with the number of protests. 

# I want to explain what I am going to analyze in this paper.

# As explained in the last few paragraphs climate change has a strong impact on Kosovo and 
# the government does not really care about the environmental rules (as it did not sign neither
# the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) nor the Kyoto Protocol) or permits. 
# So, I was wondering why in Kosovo no protest climate change take place. As for example 
# climate change has a big impact on the citizens personal life.

# For this project I follow a Hypothesis:

# "Regions experiencing climatic stress are more likely to not protest the government."

# To compare this I will use an API which describes 80 years of weather history data.

# For the number of protests I am going to use the ACLED | Armed Conflict Location & 
# Events Data set. 

# In the end, I will test if my hypothesis is significant and if there is a correlation 
# between the climatic stress (weather data) and the protests.
