# As my first version of the capstone project did not work (I think because of the format), I
# am going to try something else. 

# I really like the theme about political unrest, so protests and events, that's why I keep
# going with the protests in Kosovo. 

# Another research question came up to my mind:

# How have the frequency and intensity of violent protests in Kosovo evolved from 2018 to 2023?

Regression analysis will help you understand the relationship between the average 
interaction in cities and the frequency of different sub-event types. Hereâ€™s how you can 
approach it in R:
